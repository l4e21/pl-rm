# Prolog OO Resource Machine

To install deps, please run `swipl packs.pl`.
To load, please run `swipl load.pl`

To use in another library, please include as a pack, and call `[library(pl_rm/load)].` to load relevant paths, otherwise modules will break. This also breaks ediprolog without some alterations, sorry =(
